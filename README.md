## Java JDBC - Employee Database App

  --In this task we can store and manage Employee details in the database using MySQL. I created
    a separate database for Employee to store their data. In this we can easily add
    Employee details using addEmployee method and then view all existing employee, 
    and view a particular employee by using their id, update an employee details
    like name, role, salary by using their id. And we can also able to delete 
    employee detials from the database by using employee id.
